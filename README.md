# AirBnB Clone Project

## Project Description

This project aims to build an AirBnB clone,
starting with the development of a command-line interpreter to manage AirBnB objects.
The primary goal is to implement a parent class (`BaseModel`)
and create a flow of serialization/deserialization for instances,
along with various classes for different AirBnB objects.

## Command Interpreter

The command interpreter allows users to perform various operations on AirBnB objects,
such as creating new objects, retrieving objects, performing operations,
updating attributes, and destroying objects.

### How to Start

To start the command interpreter, run the `console.py` script:

```bash
$ ./console.py
